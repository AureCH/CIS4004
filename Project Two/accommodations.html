			<h3> What is a bungalow?</h3>
			<p>
				Our Luxury bungalows are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each bungalow has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and
				a roof dome that can be opened.
			</p>
		
			<h3> How are the bungalows furnished? </h3>
			<p>
				Each bungalow is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fire dstove. The luxury camping experience also 
				includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

			<h3> What should I bring?</h3>
			<p>
				Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for 
				changing weather with layers of clothing.
